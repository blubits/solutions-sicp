; Exercise 1.35
; =============
; Show that the golden ratio φ (1.2.2) is a fixed point of the transformation
; x -> 1 + 1/x, and use this fact to compute φ by means of the fixed-point
; procedure.
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
; Proof. The golden ratio is the positive root of the equation
;
;     x^2 - x - 1 = 0.
;
; But isolation will easily get us
;
;     x^2 = x + 1
;     x = 1 + 1/x
;
; which corresponds to the transformation above.
;
; Therefore, the golden ratio is simply

(define tolerance 0.00001)

(define (fixed-point f first-guess)
  (define (close-enough? v1 v2)
    (< (abs (- v1 v2))
       tolerance))
  (define (try guess)
    (let ((next (f guess)))
      (if (close-enough? guess next)
          next
          (try next))))
  (try first-guess))

(define (phi x) (+ 1 (/ 1.0 x)))
(fixed-point phi 1.0)
