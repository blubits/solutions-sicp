; Exercise 1.44
; =============
; The idea of smoothing a function is an important concept in signal
; processing. If f is a function and dx is some small number, then the smoothed
; version of f is the function whose value at a point x is the average of
; f(x âˆ’ dx), f(x), and f(x + dx). Write a procedure smooth that takes as input
; a procedure that computes f and returns a procedure that computes the
; smoothed f.

(define dx 0.0001)
(define (average x y z) (/ (+ x y z) 3))
(define (smooth f)
  (lambda (x)
    (average (f (- x dx)) (f x) (f (+ x dx)))))

(define (compose f g)
  (lambda (x)
    (f (g x))))

; It is sometimes valuable to repeatedly smooth a function (that
; is, smooth the smoothed function, and so on) to obtain the n-fold smoothed
; function. Show how to generate the n-fold smoothed function of any given
; function using smooth and repeated from Exercise 1.43.

(define (repeated f n)
  (if (= n 1)
      f
      (compose f (repeated f (- n 1)))))

(define (n-fold-smooth f n)
  (repeated smooth n) f)

(sin 1)

(define (square x) (* x x))
((n-fold-smooth square 2) 5)
((smooth (smooth square)) 5)
