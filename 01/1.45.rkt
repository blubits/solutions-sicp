; Exercise 1.45
; =============
; We saw in 1.3.3 that attempting to compute square roots by naively finding a
; fixed point of y -> x/y does not converge, and that this can be fixed by
; average damping. The same method works for finding cube roots as fixed points
; of the average-damped y -> x/y^2. Unfortunately, the process does not work
; for fourth roots - a single average damp is not enough to make a fixed-point
; search for y -> x/y^3 converge. On the other hand, if we average damp twice
; (i.e., use the average damp of the average damp of y -> x/y^3) the
; fixed-point search does converge.
;
; Do some experiments to determine how many average damps are required to
; compute nth roots as a fixed-point search based upon repeated average damping
; of y -> x/y^(n âˆ’ 1). Use this to implement a simple procedure for computing
; nth roots using fixed-point, average-damp, and the repeated procedure of
; Exercise 1.43. Assume that any arithmetic operations you need are available
; as primitives.
