; Exercise 1.46
; =============
; Several of the numerical methods described in this chapter are instances of
; an extremely general computational strategy known as iterative improvement.
; Iterative improvement says that, to compute something, we start with an
; initial guess for the answer, test if the guess is good enough, and otherwise
; improve the guess and continue the process using the improved guess as the
; new guess.
;
; Write a procedure iterative-improve that takes two procedures as arguments: a
; method for telling whether a guess is good enough and a method for improving
; a guess. iterative-improve should return as its value a procedure that takes
; a guess as argument and keeps improving the guess until it is good enough.

; terms of iterative-improve.
