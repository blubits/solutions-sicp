; Exercise 1.11
; =============
; A function f is defined by the rule that
;
;     f(n) = n if n < 3,
;            f(n-1) + 2f(n-2) + 3f(n-3) if n >= 3.
;
; Write a procedure that computes f by means of a recursive
; process. Write a procedure that computes f by means of an
; iterative process.

; Initial values for the iterative process:
;     a = f(2)
;     b = f(1)
;     c = f(0)
; Our goal for the iterative process:
;     a = f(n+2)
;     b = f(n+1)
;     c = f(n)
; Transformations at every step:
;     a = a + 2b + 3c       f(n+3) = f(n+2) + 2f(n+1) + 3f(n)
;     b = a                 f(n+2)
;     c = b                 f(n+1)
