# Exercise 2.9

The *width* of an interval is half of the difference between its upper and lower bounds. The width is a measure of the uncertainty of the number specified by the interval. For some arithmetic operations the width of the result of combining two intervals is a function only of the widths of the argument intervals, whereas for others the width of the combination is not a function of the widths of the argument intervals.

## Question

*Show that the width of the sum (or difference) of two intervals is a function only of the widths of the intervals being added (or subtracted).*

---

**Theorem.**

$$\mathrm{Width}([a, b] + [c, d]) = f(\mathrm{Width}([a, b]), \mathrm{Width}([c, d]))$$

**Proof**. First, note that

\[
    \mathrm{Width}([a, b]) = \frac{b-a}{2} = w_{ab}
\]

The width of $[a, b] + [c, d]$ is then

\[
    \begin{aligned}
    \mathrm{Width}([a, b] + [c, d]) &= \mathrm{Width}([a + c, b + d]) \\
    &= \frac{(b+d)-(a+c)}{2} \\
    &= \frac{b-a}{2} + \frac{d-c}{2} \\
    &= w_{ab} + w_{cd}
    \end{aligned}
\]

which is a function of the widths of the summands. A similar proof holds for subtraction. *Q.E.D*

## Question 2

*Give examples to show that this is not true for multiplication or division.*

---

Let's give a general proof instead:

**Theorem.**

$$\mathrm{Width}([a, b] \times [c, d]) \neq f(\mathrm{Width}([a, b]), \mathrm{Width}([c, d]))$$

**Proof**.

There are four possible values for the upper and lower intervals:

\[
    \begin{aligned}
        p_1 &= ac \\
        p_2 &= ad \\
        p_3 &= bc \\
        p_4 &= bd
    \end{aligned}
\]

Any pairwise combination of these four values (twelve pairs all in all) will be a function of at most one width:

|   Pair   |   Width   |   Pair   |   Width    |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| $w_{12}$ | $aw_{cd}$ | $w_{21}$ | $-aw_{cd}$ |
| $w_{13}$ | $cw_{ab}$ | $w_{31}$ | $-cw_{ab}$ |
| $w_{14}$ | $\frac{bd-ac}{2}$ | $w_{41}$ | $\frac{ac-bd}{2}$ |
| $w_{23}$ | $\frac{bc-ad}{2}$ | $w_{32}$ | $\frac{ad-bc}{2}$  |
| $w_{24}$ | $dw_{ab}$ | $w_{42}$ | $-dw_{ab}$ |
| $w_{34}$ | $bw_{cd}$ | $w_{43}$ | $-bw_{cd}$ |
