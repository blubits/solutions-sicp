; Exercise 2.6
; ============
; TODO: better explanation
; In case representing pairs as procedures wasnâ€™t mind-boggling enough,
; consider that, in a language that can manipulate procedures, we can get by
; without numbers (at least insofar as nonnegative integers are concerned) by
; implementing 0 and the operation of adding 1 as

(define zero (lambda (f) (lambda (x) x)))

(define (add-1 n)
  (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f ((n f) x)))))

; This representation is known as Church numerals, after its inventor, Alonzo
; Church, the logician who invented the lambda calculus.
;
; Define one and two directly (not in terms of zero and add-1). (Hint: Use
; substitution to evaluate (add-1 zero)). Give a direct definition of the
; addition procedure + (not in terms of repeated application of add-1).

(add-1 zero)
(lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f (((lambda (f) (lambda (x) x)) f) x))))
(lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f ((lambda (x) x) x))))
(lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f x)))

(define one (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f x))))
; As a consequence,
(lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f (f x))))

; So add is basically repeated function composition:
; x + y = f(n) composed x+y times
(define (add x y)
  (lambda (f)
    (lambda (f) (lambda (x) ((x f) ((y f) x)))))
