; Exercise 2.11
; =============
; In passing, Ben also cryptically comments: "By testing the signs of the
; endpoints of the intervals, it is possible to break mul-interval into nine
; cases, only one of which requires more than two multiplications." Rewrite
; this procedure using Benâ€™s suggestion.

; TODO finish later LMAO i hate this problem
